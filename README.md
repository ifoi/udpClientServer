### udpClientServer

To start the server run " `udpchallenge server` " and

" `udpchallenge.py 127.0.0.1 <text> ` " to start the client ( where `<text>`  is the string you want to send to the server. If the sting is an int or float, the server will double it and send the results back to the client)

TODO:

- ~~currently working on inttegrating them into udpClientServer.py so that both client and server can be started from that one file. ~~
- Implement tests
