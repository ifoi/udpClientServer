### udpClientServer

To start the server run " `udpchallenge server` " and

" `udpchallenge.py 127.0.0.1 <text> ` " to start the client
( where `<text>`  is the string you want to send to the server.  <br/> If the sting is an int or float, the server will double it and send the results back to the client  <br/>
otherwise it returns a message indicating that the `input must be a number` )


TODO:

- ~~currently working on inttegrating them into udpClientServer.py so that both client and server can be started from that one file. ~~
- Implement tests
